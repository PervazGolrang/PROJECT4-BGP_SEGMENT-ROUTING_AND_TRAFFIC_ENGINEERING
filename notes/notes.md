WIP - slett etterpå

- activation of cat8000v license, can use applet to reduce time.

`license boot level network-premiere addon dna-premiere` <- kan være typo, skrevet fra minne

- sjekk, skal cust2_bgo være koblet til isp2_bgo eller bare til r2_bgo, samt med cust1_oslo

- enable ksm, cml off by default

- Wanted to experiment more with BGP, with RR, where I did a Project3, but did not mention Cluster-ID, also that I did not create a Peer-Group. I've read a litle bit of the CCNP SP, and found BGP interesting. Even though I'm not studying for CCNP SP, I would still like to understand the basics.
